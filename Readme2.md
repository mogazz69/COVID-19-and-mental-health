### * U of T Data Analytics Final Project. *

## ** Segment 1 **

## Selected Topic:  	* The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health *
### Reason of Selection: * Ongoing pandemic and its impact on mental health of various levels of communities *

## Source of Data: [Centers of Disease Control and Prevention] (https://www.cdc.gov)
> The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

> The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions,

### Question: * What group is most affected in terms of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic? * 
> Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, depression and anxiety in various age group as well as in levels of community.
>People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to infection, they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death. "Good mental health is absolutely fundamental to overall health and well-being."

### Team Communication and Collaboration:
> Team members are communicating through Slack medium and having Zoom meetings during scheduled class time and as on demand basis.

### Database Selection
> We are using **sql** to established the database **"Mental"**. 
> The **tables** we are using is Depression_2020, Anxiety_2020, Either_2020, Sex_2020, Race_2020, Age_2020, Edu_2020, and State_2020.

> We extract the factor tables such as Sex, Race, Age, Edu, and State to investigate the information about each group and  preparing for further visualization and machine learning model training. (test_revised_Shery.ipynb is the file to extract and clean the factor tables)
